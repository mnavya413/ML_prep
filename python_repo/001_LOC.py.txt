    'Store_ID': [101, 102, 103, 104, 105],
    'Store_Name': ['Paws and Play', 'Pet Paradise', 'Whisker Wonders', 'Fin & Feather', 'Bark & Purr'],
    'Location': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix'],
    'Specialty': ['Dogs', 'Cats', 'Fish', 'Birds', 'Reptiles'],
    'Annual_Revenue($1000s)': [500, 400, 300, 450, 320]

# Create DataFrame

#LOC questions
How would you use the loc method to select all the details of the store with Store_ID 103?

Using loc, how can you extract the Specialty and Annual_Revenue($1000s) columns for stores located in 'Los Angeles' or 'Houston'?

If you wanted to change the Specialty of the store with Store_ID 105 to 'All Pets', how would you achieve this using the loc method?

How would you filter out stores using loc that have an Annual_Revenue($1000s) of more than 400?

Using the loc method, how can you retrieve the Store_Name and Location for the last two rows in the DataFrame?

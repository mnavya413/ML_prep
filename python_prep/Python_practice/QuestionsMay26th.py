# take another variable called tempmax=max(sortedlist)
# sort that list in descending order
# get the last eleemnt in this descending order sorted list
# check if the element is equal to the minimum element in that list
# check how many numbers in the list are Even
# multiply every element with 2
# check number of even numbers in the list
# check divisibilty of 5 with every element
# get the count of numbers divisible by 7
# create another list which are first five multiples of 8 and add it to the previous list
# sort the whole list in ascending order
# remove the last element using pop
# using for loop remove all the elements divisible by 4
